## Use the Pandas module for the following

# 1. Use the Describe function to log to the console basic statistical analysis of an Excel file with numbers in it.

# 2. Use the Merge function so that actual names and emails can be included in user_visits.csv from the Bridge Data Dump. You will also need users.csv from the same dump.

## Use the OpenPyxl module for the following

# 1. Copy a column of text from one workbook to another workbook.

# 2. CHALLENGE: If you want a challenge, recreate Pandas merge using just OpenPyxl, so that every time a userID is found on both user_visits and users, it then adds the values for name and email in user_visits.
#				Note: For this challenge, user_visits and users will have to be saved as xlsx

## Use the Requests module for the following

# 1. Access the Bridge API and print to the console log an array of the custom fields we have on our Bridge system.

#		NOTE: You will also have to create an API key and secret in Bridge. This can be done in https://globaltiesus.bridgeapp.com/admin/config
#			You should then click on the API tab and then click Add Token. Be sure to jot down either in an IDE file or just somewhere, the key and secret. Change the Role from
#			Learner to Account Admin when creating the token.

# 2. CHALLENGE: Access the Bridge API and count every learner who has completed a program from the summary information for a user.
